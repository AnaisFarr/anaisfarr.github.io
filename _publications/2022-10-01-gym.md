Gymnastics, and more specifically landing, is associated with a high rate of injuries, particularly to the back. This is due to the fact that landing involves strong ground reaction forces as well as important body rotations, hence as a result of repetitive landing, these movement patterns can lead to significant muscle fatigue, which increases the risk of injury. The main objective of this study is to predict the fatigue in the lumbar region during landing repetitions only using the kinematic data of the athlete. A second objective of our research is to identify the best machine learning model for our data and the variables that would most predict fatigue during gymnastics landing.
