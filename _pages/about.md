I am a PhD student in neuroscience at the CIAMS laboratory at the University of Paris-Saclay.
My research focuses on models of movement correction following perturbations.
Alongside my research, I am involved in teaching and science outreach.
I am passionate about making science accessible to everyone and inspiring young people to pursue research and scientific careers.
